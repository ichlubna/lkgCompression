./dof.sh dataset/scene
Creates the dof views into the ./fullDof folder.
./measureAllDataset.sh dataset/scene
Measures the compression efficiency for the scenes.
./measureMetrics.sh dataset/scene/full outputReport outputReportBlended decompressedViewsDir
Measures the compression for one scene.
./measureQuality.sh firstFile secondFile
